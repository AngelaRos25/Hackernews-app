This project is realized for [start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/)'s module "Javascript Advanced" in Front-End developer course.

## The Assignment:
The assignment of this project is to create an application to share news in a tech environment.
I created a dummy div, then called the API [Hacker News](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and I showed the result of the API call inside the dummy div that, consequently, creates 10 additional divs. A "Load More" button can be found at the bottom of the page and, if clicked, it creates other 10 divs with the news inside.
